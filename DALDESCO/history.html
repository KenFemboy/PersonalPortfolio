        <p><span class="tab"></span>A group of five desgruntled employees from different local printing press in Davao del Norte, sometime in 1984, approached Mr. Bernado O. Gulle, the then Provincial Cooperative Development Officer of the Department of Agriculture on the possibility of organizing a printing press cooperative. Mr. Gulle with his utmost honesty advised the (the Group) to just forget their plan because of the analogous imposibility to form a printing press coop since there is no basis for success, no study was done anf even there was no printing press yet organized in the entire region 11; and besides that, Presedential Decree No. 175 requires TWO HUNDRED FIFTY (250) persons to organized a full-pledge cooperative; thus, the <b>IMPOSIBILITY</b></p>
        <img src="resources/img/daldesco_collage_a.png" id="picture_collage">
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Few days later, the same group bringing the feasibility study showing the profitability of the printing press business in Davao del Norte came back and explained to Mr. Gulle the necessity of operating a printing press cooperative since there was no coop yet engaged in printing business in Region 11 at the time.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Convince by the good presentation, Mr. Gulle contacted some selected coop leaders and sold the idea forming a printing cooperative. The response of the people was positive. Thus, the printing press cooperative was conceptualized and registered as Davao Allied Development and services Cooperative (DALDESCO) Samahang Nayon, on June 8, 1984 at the Office of the Provincial Executive Officer, Department of Agriculture, Tagum, Davao since it could not qualify as a full-pledged cooperative due to the minimum initial requirement of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY (250) cooperative members.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span> The cooperative member contributed ONE THOUSAND Pesos (Php 1,000) each amounting to the sum of FIFTEEN THOUSAND (15,000) pesos as a startup capital since there were only FIFTEEN (15) initial cooperative members, composed of both primary cooperative (NAMES OF PRIMARY COOPS) and individual persons. To wit the original cooperative members are:</p>

        <p><span class="tab"></span>It was really difficult to start business with meager capital, but heaven was with DALDESCO. A generous printing machines supplier in Davao City allowed the purchase of machines and other printing equipment and supplies in an instalment basis. This was great help to the Cooperative in starting its business.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-history">
        <p><br><br><span class="tab"></span>The business went on smoothly in its first two years of operation because the patrons, most of them were cooperative, local government units, and coop-oriented individuals were satisfied and excited of the Coop's services; however, due to misplacement and governace problem DALDESCO suffered setbacksin the succeeding years. Management's dishonesty, incompetence, lack of printing business expertise, lack of marketing strategies, employees' over-complacency, running the printing press without a clear business plan, and many other deficiences were just some of the causes of DALDESCO's debacle. So in the first TEN (10) years of operations, the Cooperative experienced a fast turnover of managers. Regrettably DALDESCO changes its managers five times within ten years.</p>
        <img src="resources/img/staff_pic.jpg" id="picture_collage">
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Those catastrophic years touted DALDESCO's leaders to change paradigm because they could not afford to see their efforts be withered and buried in the oblivion. Members were already involved through the conduct of ownership meetings to download the information direct to them; strategic plan was crafted; vision, mission, goals, and values were created Manual of policies was formulatedto guide the leaders in managing the business; trainings and seminars were given importance, and business innovation was a priority. New machines were installed and computerized designing was applied. Furthermore, the Board of led in marketing the product of DALDESCO which opened the mind of the people that there is a Cooperative Printing Press existing in the Province of Davao del Norte</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>This paradigm shift gave positive results to the business of DALDESCO. Customers started flocking to avail the service of the Cooperative and the losses were reverted. The influx of costumers prompted the officers not only to produced new printing machines and other equipment but also to build an office and printing plant owned by DALDESCO. With the help of the Federation of People Sustainable Development Cooperative (FPSDC) finacial services, DALDESCO is now operating in its new building at Gante Road 2, Tagum City where the office and the printing plant are housed.</p>
        <!--<img src="picture_collage_2.png" id="picture_collage">-->
        <p><span class="tab"></span>In 2015 the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) though its Regional Office 11 advised DALDESCO's management to change the name DALDESCO by removing the word development in order to be consistent with R. A. 9520, The Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008, hence the name now is DALDESCO Printing Service Cooperative.</p>

        <p><span class="tab"></span>Today DALDESCO is safer in the hands of vigilant members, strong Board of Directors and other officers, and good management and staff.</p>
